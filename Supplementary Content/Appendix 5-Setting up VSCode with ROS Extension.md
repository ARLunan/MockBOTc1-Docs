### Appendix 5: Setting up and using Microsoft VSCode  Application with ROS Extension, Remote Development Extension and the “Out-of-the-Box Git/Github source control code management.
**Installation**  

The **VSCode** application can be installed on Linux – Ubuntu, Windows , and Mac machines. It is suggested that it be installed on your **Local Robot Development Desktop Machine** where it can manage code development on both that **Desktop Machine** and the  **Remote Raspberry Pi Robot  Machine (SBC)**. Extensions are available to very conveniently support **ROS 2** code development and a “**SSH-Remote**” connection function to connect to, install and edit packages on the Raspberry Pi Robot. VSCode now includes Microsoft CoPilot provides AI-powered inline code suggestions as you type.

Steps:  

Setting up **SSH Key**s on the Local Desktop Workstation Machine and Remote Rasapberry Pi.  

Installing the VSCode** Remote SSH** Extension Pack, that is actually a remote VSCode Server
Connecting to a remote computer (i.e. the Raspberry Pi) over SSH  

Installing the ROS extension on the remote computer
Uploading, compiling and running the code

Using GitSource Control in VS Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview describes the use of Git in VSCode and what Extensions might be installed. 

In addition to the above Extensions, suggest reviewing the list of Recommended Extensions where  these are particularly relevent for ROS 2 development: Microsoft C/C+, Git, Preview, Print, ROS2, Preview, Print, ROS2. Also consider installing GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant deeply integrated into Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to help developers write code faster and more efficiently.  It provides features ranging from simple code completions to autonomous task execution, based on the context of your project and natural language prompts.  

And GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant integrated into Visual Studio Code. It provides code suggestions, explanations, and automated implementations based on natural language prompts and existing code context. Copilot has been trained on public code repositories and can assist with most programming languages and frameworks.
